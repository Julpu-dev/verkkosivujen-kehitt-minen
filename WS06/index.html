            I can buy myself flowers
            Write my name in the sand
            Talk to myself for hours
            Say things you don't understand
            I can take myself dancing
            And I can hold my own hand</div>

    <article>

        <div>
            Paint my nails cherry red
            Match the roses that you left
            No remorse, no regret
            I forgive every word you said</div>

        <div>We were good, we were gold
            Kinda dream that can't be sold
            We were right 'til we weren't
            Built a home and watched it burn</div>
