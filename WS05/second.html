        <div>Day one:
            No sun
            Stripped of our names
            Now we are merely numbers
            Permanently inked in the flames
            Our kind
            Our existence lights the fire
            Igniting hell on earth
            Archangels bending crosses hooked
            Innocent men, women, children
            Sentenced before conviction
            With golden stars to guide them
            Their gavel is the end of a gun</div>

        <div>Day two:
            Lived through
            More culprits arrive
            Every cage so crowded
            How will we survive through the night?
            Our kind
            Our existence lights the fire
            Igniting hell on earth
            Archangels bending crosses
            Hooked
            First day in hell</div>

        <div>Week five:
            Alive
            Soon out of time
            After all that I've here witnessed
            There's no value in life
            Our kind
            Our existence lights the fire
            Igniting hell on earth
            Archangels bending crosses</div>
